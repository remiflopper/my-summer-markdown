## Goals for the school year
I wish to get a 3.5 or better GPA, meet some new people, and just learn.

## Favorite memory with friends
I had many favorite memory with friends this summer. One memory was when me and my twin went to our cabin in Sequoia with our friends Elijah and Andy. This was very fun because we all got to hang out and have a good time. Another favorite memory this summer was having all the pool parties at my house with all my friends. This memory I cherish because we did so many things together.
